I have made project using Pharma product sales dataset which shows state wise sales count with total no of sales, no of count of product quantity and total net amount.
Done Data cleaning and Exploratory data analysis using the dataset and data visualisation using visualisation tool like seaborn and matplotlib to show the sales count state wise in visualisation manner.
In the final conclusion get to know which state has highest no of sales of product, total net amount of product and no of count of product quantities.
